This demo illustrates how to use the [DxChartSeriesPointImage](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartSeriesPointImage) component to specify custom images for points. To do this, handle the [CustomizeSeriesPoint](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartBase.CustomizeSeriesPoint) event and use the event argument's [PointAppearance.Image](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.ChartSeriesPointImageModel) property to access a point's image settings.
