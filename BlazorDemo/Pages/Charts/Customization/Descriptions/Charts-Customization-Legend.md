The [DxChartSeriesLegendItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartSeriesLegendItem) component in a chart series' markup allows you to customize a legend item's appearance. This component allows you to change a legend item's position and visibility. You can also customize the legend item text via the [Text](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartSeriesLegendItem.Text) and [TextTemplate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartSeriesLegendItem.TextTemplate) properties. To show and hide series when a user clicks the corresponding legend item, set the [AllowToggleSeries](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartLegend.AllowToggleSeries) property to **true** .
