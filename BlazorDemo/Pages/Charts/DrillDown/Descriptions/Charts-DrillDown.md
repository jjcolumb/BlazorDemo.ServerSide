You can create drill-down charts to visualize hierarchical data and allow users to explore its details. In this demo, yearly product sales are distributed between company branches and product categories. Click bar series points, area series, and breadcrumb items to navigate detail levels.

The demo uses a [template](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartCommonSeries-4.SeriesTemplate) to create series. The template is configured to apply individual settings to series types. Data fields that correspond to arguments and series names are passed as [expressions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.expressions.expression?view=net-6.0) to obtain data for a specific detail level.

The demo handles the [SeriesClick](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChart-1.SeriesClick) and onClick events to respond to element clicks and switch between data detail levels. Depending on the level, the chart loads and displays corresponding data.
