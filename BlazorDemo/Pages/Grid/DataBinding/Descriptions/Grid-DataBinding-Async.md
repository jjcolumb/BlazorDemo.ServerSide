In this demo, our Blazor [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403143/grid) is bound to a data collection that is available after asynchronous component initialization. To implement this specific usage scenario, bind the [Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.Data) parameter to a C# field or property. Once bound, populate this field or property with data in the [OnInitializeAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/lifecycle?view=aspnetcore-6.0#component-initialization-oninitializedasync) lifecycle method (use the [await](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/await) operator).
