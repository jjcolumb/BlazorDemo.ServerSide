In this demo, the DevExpress Blazor [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid)'s edit form contains two [cascading Comboboxes](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxComboBox-2#cascading-comboboxes): **Country** and **City**. The **City** combobox is dynamically populated with items based on the value selected within the **Country** combobox. Use the [Value](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxComboBox-2.Value) property to access the selected item. To respond to changes made, handle the [ValueChanged](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxComboBox-2.ValueChanged) event.
