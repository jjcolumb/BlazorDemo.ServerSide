This demo illustrates how you can group scheduled appointments by date. When appointments are grouped by date and the [Scheduler](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxScheduler) component displays multiple dates and resources, resource headers are grouped under date headers.

To group appointments by date, set the [GroupType](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxScheduler.GroupType) property to `Date`.
