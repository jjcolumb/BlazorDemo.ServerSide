DevExpress Reporting allows you to specify how to process hidden cells in reports. In this demo, use the parameter in the Parameters panel to hide a column and see the XRTable.ProcessHiddenCellMode property's Resize Cells Proportionally mode in action: when a column is hidden, the remaining columns are resized, and empty space is eliminated.
