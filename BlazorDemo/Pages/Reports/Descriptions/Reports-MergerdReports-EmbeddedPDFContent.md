This demo illustrates an invoice report that includes a PDF specification for each invoice item. The <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XRPdfContent" target="_blank">XRPdfContent</a> control is used to embed PDF specification pages and make their paper kind the same as in the invoice report. Report controls are used to add additional information to the PDF pages, such as item description, item price, line, logo image, and sequential page numbers.
