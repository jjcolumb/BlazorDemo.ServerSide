This demo illustrates how to use the Cross Tab control to create a Balance Sheet report. In this demo, the Cross Tab's HierarchicalRowLayout property is enabled to display rows in a tree-like form. Grand total values and field headers are hidden, and column field values are grouped by years. The GroupRowIndex variable is used in expressions to apply odd and even row styles.

Refer to the Sales Summary Report demo for another Cross Tab layout.
