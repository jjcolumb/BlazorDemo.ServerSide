This demo illustrates how to use the Subreport control to create master-detail reports. This approach is useful if your data source does not contain ADO.NET relationships or if you want to associate the Subreport control with a detail report you use across reports.
Refer to the Master-Detail Report demo to see another approach to create master-detail reports.
