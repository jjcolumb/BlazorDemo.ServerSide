This demo illustrates how you can display Group Header content across a group. The Group Header's PrintAcrossBands property is active and the controls within the band are printed as a background layer for subsequent Group Header, Detail and Group Footer bands. The Detail band's FillEmptySpace property is enabled to get rid of the gap between details and totals.
