Use the [MinDate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxCalendar-1.MinDate) and [MaxDate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxCalendar-1.MaxDate) properties to specify a range of available dates. The calendar disables dates that are out of the range and hides navigation arrows for them.
 
In this demo, the Calendar component allows users to select dates from the current year.
