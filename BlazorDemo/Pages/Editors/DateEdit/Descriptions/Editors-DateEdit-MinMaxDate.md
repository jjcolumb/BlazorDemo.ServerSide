Use the [MinDate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxCalendar-1.MinDate) and [MaxDate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxCalendar-1.MaxDate) properties to specify a range of available dates. The Blazor Date Edit's calendar disables dates that are out of range and hides navigation arrows as appropriate. If a user enters a date that is out of range, the DevExpress Blazor Date Edit retains the previously selected date.

In this demo, the Blazor Date Edit component allows users to select dates within the current month.
