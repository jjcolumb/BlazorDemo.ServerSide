If the mask types listed above do not meet your requirements, you can use the [Regular Expression](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/402517/data-editors/masks/regular-expression-masks) mask type. The syntax is similar to the [POSIX ERE](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Regular_Expressions/POSIX-Extended_Regular_Expressions) specification.

To apply this mask type to the Masked Input, set the component's [MaskMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMaskedInput-1.MaskMode) property to MaskMode.RegEx.

The **Autocomplete Mode**, **Placeholder**, and **Show Placeholders** settings specify additional mask properties.
