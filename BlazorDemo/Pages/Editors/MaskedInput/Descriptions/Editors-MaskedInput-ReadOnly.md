In this demo, the Masked Input displays values but does not allow users to change them. To implement this behavior, use any of the following modes:

*   Read-only mode. In this mode, you can use the keyboard to focus and navigate the component. Set the [ReadOnly](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxDataEditor-1.ReadOnly) property to **true** to activate this mode.
*   Disabled mode. In this mode, the component cannot receive input focus. Set the [Enabled](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxDataEditor-1.Enabled) property to **false** to activate this mode.
