Enable multiple selection mode with optimized performance if the Data Grid contains a significant number of rows. To do this, set the [SelectionMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDataGrid-1.SelectionMode) property to [DataGridSelectionMode.OptimizedMultipleSelection](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DataGridSelectionMode) and specify the [KeyFieldName](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDataGrid-1.KeyFieldName) property.

In this mode, the Data Grid does not store row data objects and information about all the selected rows. The Data Grid stores row key values instead. If you select all rows in the Data Grid UI or in code, and then unselect rows, the component stores keys of unselected rows only (and vice versa). This mode reduces the amount of stored data and increases performance, but may corrupt database integrity.

Add the [DxDataGridSelectionColumn](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDataGridSelectionColumn) to select data rows with checkboxes. Set the [SelectAllMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDataGrid-1.SelectAllMode) property to [AllPages](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DataGridSelectAllMode) to select all data rows simultaneously with the **Select All** checkbox. To track selection changes in this mode, use the [OptimizedMultipleSelectionChanged](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDataGrid-1.OptimizedMultipleSelectionChanged) event.
