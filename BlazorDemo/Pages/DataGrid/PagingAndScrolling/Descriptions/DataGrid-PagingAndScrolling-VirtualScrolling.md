Set the [DataNavigationMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDataGrid-1.DataNavigationMode) property to [VirtualScrolling](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DataGridNavigationMode) to enable virtual scrolling in our Data Grid. The Data Grid loads and renders only the data rows that become visible. Note that this mode requires that all rows have the same height.

In this mode, the Data Grid does not display the pager and opens the Edit Form in a pop-up window.
