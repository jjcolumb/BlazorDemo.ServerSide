In this demo, the DevExpress Blazor [Data Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDataGrid-1) is bound to a data collection with over a million rows (1GB+ in overall size). Navigate between grid pages, sort data, or filter data to experience our Blazor DataGrid's responsiveness and performance capabilities when binding to large datasets.

You can use any of the ways demonstrated above (the [Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDataGrid-1.Data), [DataAsync](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDataGrid-1.DataAsync), or [CustomData](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDataGrid-1.CustomData) property) to bind the grid to a large data collection. The collection must implement the [IQueryable\<T>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.iqueryable-1) interface. This demo uses the **DataAsync** property and Entity Framework Core.
