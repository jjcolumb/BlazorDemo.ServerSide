Our Blazor [Data Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDataGrid-1) allows you to display, manage, and manipulate tabular data with absolute ease. You can use the [Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDataGrid-1.Data) property to bind the grid to a strongly typed collection. Initialize this collection in the [OnInitialized](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/lifecycle#component-initialization-oninitializedasync) lifecycle method or before this method is invoked. To display data within our Blazor Grid, simply [add columns](GridColumnTypes) to the markup and use the [Field](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDataGridColumn.Field) property to assign data fields as needed.
