The DevExpress Accordion for Blazor allows you to display collapsible panels and organize information on pages with space constraints. You can also use this component as a navigation control: arrange navigation links into a multi-level structure.  

The control's built-in filter UI allows users to quickly locate items. 

The control stores its root-level elements in the [Items](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxAccordion.Items) collection. For each item, you can specify its text, icon, and child items or [collapsible content](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxAccordionItem.ContentTemplate). 

The following properties control user capability to expand and collapse items: 

* [ExpandMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxAccordion.ExpandMode) - Specifies how many items can be expanded at a time. 
* [ExpandCollapseAction](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxAccordion.ExpandCollapseAction) - Specifies the user's action that expands or collapses the item.
