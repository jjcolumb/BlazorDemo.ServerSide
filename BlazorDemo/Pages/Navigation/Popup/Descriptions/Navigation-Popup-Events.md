You can handle the following events to process show and close actions:
-	[Showing](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxPopupBase.Showing) / [Closing](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxPopupBase.Closing) - Occur before the Popup is displayed/closed and allow you to cancel these actions.
-	[Shown](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxPopupBase.Shown) /  [Closed](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxPopupBase.Closed) - Occur after the Popup is displayed/closed.

In this demo, a second Popup component appears if you do not select the checkbox in the first Popup.
