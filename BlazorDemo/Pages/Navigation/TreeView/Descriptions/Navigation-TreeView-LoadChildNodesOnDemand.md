In this mode, the DevExpress [TreeView](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeView) component loads a node's children when the node is expanded for the first time. This mode allows you to improve the TreeView's performance for tree structures with a large number of nodes.

You can use the "**Load Child Nodes on Demand**" mode for bound and unbound TreeView nodes. To activate this mode, set the [LoadChildNodesOnDemand](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeView.LoadChildNodesOnDemand) property to `true`. In the bound mode, specify the [DxTreeViewDataMapppingBase.HasChildren](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxTreeViewDataMappingBase.HasChildren) property that indicates whether a node has child nodes. The TreeView uses this property to render nodes before they are expanded for the first time.
