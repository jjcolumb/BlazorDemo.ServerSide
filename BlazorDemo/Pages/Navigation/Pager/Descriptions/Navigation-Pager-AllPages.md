This example demonstrates the [Pager](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxPager) component that displays all its page numbers simultaneously.

When all page numbers are displayed, the Pager's navigation buttons are hidden. To disable this behavior and always display navigation buttons, set the [AutoHideNavButtons](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxPager.AutoHideNavButtons) property to **false**.
